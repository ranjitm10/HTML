## HTML

## Basic HTML
#Introduction :-
            HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the language in which websites are written. They form the skeleton of the websites, storing the content in a structured manner.
            HTML blocks are building blocks of HTML pages. HTML allows us to add a variety of objects to a web page including tables, images, videos, forms, etc.
            
#Intro & Inline Elements :
            The simplest way to write HTML is just to write some text inside Elements.
            
            <br>, <b>, <i>, <u>, <sup>, <sub>, <code>, <a> are all rendered as inline elements.
            These elements render on the same line and do not break the flow of content.
            
#Block Elements :
            1- The heading tags are //<h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5> and <h6>//
            2- The pragraph tags are //<p>Pragraph</p>//
            3- Lists - a) orderList <ol> <li></li> </ol>   b) unordered List <ul> <li><li> </ul>
            4- Blockquote - The HTML <blockquote> element indicates that the enclosed text is an extended quotation. Usually, this is rendered visually by indentation.
            5- Preformatted Text:
            The HTML <pre> element represents preformatted text which is to be presented exactly as written in the HTML file. 
            The text is typically rendered using a monospace font. Whitespace inside this element is displayed as written.
            
            Example:
            
            <pre>A B   C
            D E   F G
            H I</pre>
            
            <h1> - <h6>, <p>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>, <hr>, <blockquote>, <pre> all represent block level elements.

            A Block-level element occupies the entire horizontal space of its parent element (container), and vertical space equal to the height of its contents.

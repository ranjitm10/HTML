# <h4>Introduction</h4> :-

   - HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the language in which websites are written. They form the skeleton of the websites, storing the content in a structured manner.
   - HTML blocks are building blocks of HTML pages. HTML allows us to add a variety of objects to a web page including tables, images, videos, forms, etc.

# <h4>Intro & Inline Elements</h4> :
            The simplest way to write HTML is just to write some text inside Elements.
            
        <br>, <b>, <i>, <u>, <sup>, <sub>, <code>, <a> are all rendered as inline elements.
  
  These elements render on the same line and do not break the flow of content.

# <h4>Block Elements</h4> :

1- The heading tags are h1, h2, h3, h4, h5 and h6<br>
2- The pragraph tags are p<br>
3- Lists - a) orderList <ol> <li></li> </ol>   b) unordered List <ul> <li><li> </ul> <br>
4- Blockquote - The HTML <blockquote> element indicates that the enclosed text is an extended quotation. Usually, this is rendered visually by indentation.
5- Preformatted Text:
     The HTML element represents preformatted text which is to be presented exactly as written in the HTML file. 
     The text is typically rendered using a monospace font. Whitespace inside this element is displayed as written.
            
            Example:
            
            <pre>A B   C
            D E   F G
            H I</pre>
            
      <h1> - <h6>, <p>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>, <hr>, <blockquote>, <pre> all represent block level elements.

A Block-level element occupies the entire horizontal space of its parent element (container), and vertical space equal to the height of its contents.
